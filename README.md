### Version One Requirements

#### Visuals

- The application should display a picture of a cat and a number of clicks.
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

#### Interaction

- The number of clicks should increment when the cat picture is clicked.


### Version Two Requirements

#### Visuals
- The application should display two cats. Each cat includes:
	- the cat's name
	- a picture of the cat
	- text showing the number of clicks
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

#### Interaction
The number of clicks should increment when each cat picture is clicked.

For this version, it is strongly recommended that you avoid the most naive of solutions. Don't just hardcode the cat name in the DOM or in the document. Instead, store the name in a JavaScript variable, and then update the document.


### Project Requirements for Cat Clicker Premium

#### Visuals
The application should display
- a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
- an area to display the selected cat

In the cat display area, the following should be displayed
- the cat's name
- a picture of the cat
- text showing the number of clicks

The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

#### Interaction
- When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
- The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.
