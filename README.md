# Cat Clicker App

This app will be built while completing the lessons in Udacity's first unit on front end application developement, Changing Expectations. It is based on Ben Jaffe's original online hit game, Cow Clicker

### Version One Requirements

#### Visuals

- The application should display a picture of a cat and a number of clicks.
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

#### Interaction

- The number of clicks should increment when the cat picture is clicked.

#### Inspiration

### Version Two Requirements

#### Visuals
- The application should display two cats. Each cat includes:
	- the cat's name
	- a picture of the cat
	- text showing the number of clicks
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

#### Interaction
The number of clicks should increment when each cat picture is clicked.

For this version, it is strongly recommended that you avoid the most naive of solutions. Don't just hardcode the cat name in the DOM or in the document. Instead, store the name in a JavaScript variable, and then update the document.
